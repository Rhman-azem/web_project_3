**description**    
  
This is a project that showcases the hometowns of some of Practicum's employees and my hometown.  
  
**technologies I used **  
  
The main focus was making the website responsice & displayed correctly on popular screen sizes which was possible by using **@media** & **grid**.
I used **:hover** & **opacity** to make a darker background layer for the buttons and __cover__ section.
